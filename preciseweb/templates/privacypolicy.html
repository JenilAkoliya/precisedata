      <ul style="user-select: auto;">
        <li style="user-select: auto;">Non-Personal Information. This is information that is un-identified and
          non-identifiable, which is generated by a user's activity. Such non-personal information may include the
          following information - browser type, web pages you visit, time spent on those pages, access times and dates.
        </li>
        <li style="user-select: auto;">Personal Information. Personal information is information that identifies you or
          may identify you. The Personal Information we collect and retain includes your IP address, your name and email
          address, identifying documents (driver license/ID/passport), office/home address, screen name, payment and
          billing information or other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the on-boarding
          process and services provisioning. In some cases, we may record audio or video calls with you, in order to
          comply with User compliance evaluation requirements we are subject to and our internal guidelines. When you

          party website or service ("<b style="user-select: auto;">Third Party Account</b>") such as GmailÂ®. Doing so
          will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party
          Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the
          types of information that we will obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your
          Third Party Account, such as user-name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences. Any
          Anonymous Information that is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is treated by us
          as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.</li>

        combined information as personal information.</p>

        information will include, in most cases, basic contact information, such as name, email and job title ("<b
